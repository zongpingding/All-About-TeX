\chapter{Preface}
The Willow Tree Book class is a simplified derivative of the \verb!memoir! book class.
I use it for my lecture notes.
The document you are reading is in the Willow Tree Book class.

\chapter{Use}
Here is a typical book using the Willow Tree Book class:
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=leftline]
\documentclass{willowtreebook}
\Title{Odyssey}
\Author{Homer}
\BibliographyFile{odyssey} 		
	% The name of the .bib file, without file extension.
\begin{document}
\chapter{Preface}
This is the preface to my book.
\afterpreface
\chapter{We meet Odysseus}
Tell me, O muse, of that ingenious hero
    % The rest of the text goes here.
Thus spoke Minerva, and Ulysses obeyed her gladly. Then Minerva assumed
the form and voice of Mentor, and presently made a covenant of peace
between the two contending parties.
\par\bigskip\noindent
THE END
	% End the document without loading the bibliography
	% or the index, or the list of notation.
\end{document}
\end{Verbatim}
Compile with \verb!latex! or \verb!pdflatex!.
\chapter{Definitions, Problems and Theorems}
\section{Definitions}
We can define a term like \emph{hamster}\define{hamster}, or say that the term hamster\SubIndex{hamster} appears again later.

\end{Verbatim}
Compile, for a book called \verb!filename.tex!, with
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=leftline]
	makeindex filename
\end{Verbatim}
We add notation like when we use a variable called \(\omega\),
we put it in the list of notation.%
\Notation{omega}{\omega}{A variable called $\omega$}

\Notation{omega}{\omega}{A variable called $\omega$}
\end{Verbatim}
If you use notation, compile with
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=leftline]
	makeindex -s notation.gst -o not.gls not.glo  
\end{Verbatim}
\section{Problems}
\begin{problem}{label.for.the.first.problem}
What is the point of your life?
\end{problem}
\begin{answer}{label.for.the.first.problem}
Your life is pointless.
\end{answer}
In problem~\ref{problem:label.for.the.first.problem}, we can clearly see ...
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=leftline]
		% We add problems by:
\begin{problem}{label.for.the.first.problem}

\end{problem}
		% and answers by:
\begin{answer}{label.for.the.first.problem}
Your life is pointless.
\end{answer}

\chapter{Citations}
Our bibliography file looks like
\VerbatimInput[frame=leftline]{willowtreebook.bib}
We can cite works from the bibliography, like Homer~\cite{Homer:Iliad}, p. 12.
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=leftline]

\end{Verbatim}
Compile with \verb!bibtex!.
\section{Theorems}
You have the usual theorem environments, like \texttt{amsthm}.
\begin{theorem}[Pythagoras]
In any triangle with sides of lengths \(a,b,c\), \(a^2+b^2=c^2\) just when the angle opposite the side of length \(c\) is a right angle.
\end{theorem}

\section{Examples}
I often want to present an example, and make clear where it starts and stops.
\begin{example}
The integral 
\[
\int e^{x^2}x\,dx
\]
is evaluated by substituting \(u=x^2\), so
\[
\int e^{x^2}x\,dx=\int e^u \frac{du}{2}.
\]
\end{example}

\section{Preambles}
We can put some \LaTeX{} code before the hints:
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=leftline]
\RenewDocumentCommand\hintsPreamble{}{
\par\noindent{}
\textit{When you are describing, \\ 
A shape, or sound, or tint; \\ 
Don't state the matter plainly, \\ 
But put it in a hint; \\
And learn to look at all things, \\ 
With a sort of mental squint.}
\par\noindent{}---\ {Lewis Carroll}}
\end{Verbatim}

or before the bibliography:
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=leftline]
\RenewDocumentCommand\bibliographyPreamble{}{
\par\noindent
\textit{If those books are in agreement with the Quran, 
we have no need of them; 
and if these are opposed to the Quran,

\end{Verbatim}

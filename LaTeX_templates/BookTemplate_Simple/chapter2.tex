    Let \( A \) be a Noetherian domain of dimension one. Then the following are equivalent:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \( A \) is integrally closed;
        \item Every primary ideal in \( A \) is a prime power;
        \item Every local ring \( A_\mathfrak{p} \) \( (\mathfrak{p} \neq 0) \) is a discrete valuation ring.
    \end{enumerate}

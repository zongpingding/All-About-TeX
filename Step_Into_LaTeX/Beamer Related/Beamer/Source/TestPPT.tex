In this talk I will give a very elementary proof of the 
theorem.  I am surprised that no one else has thought of 
this before.

Fermat's Last Theorem says that the equation 
\[ 
  x^2 + y^2 = z^2 
\] 
has no solution in the set of natural numbers.

This is not true.  After a lengthy calculation on the 
department's Linux machines, I have verified that within 
the numerical accuracy of the Pentium-4 processor, we have: 
\[ 
  5000^2 + 12000^2 = 13000^2 
\]
